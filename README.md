# ResQon - Emergency Response Navigation System

ResQon is an advanced emergency response navigation system that provides real-time pathfinding and rescue coordination capabilities for emergency response teams. The system combines building information modeling, real-time environmental mapping, and AI-driven decision making to create optimal rescue routes during emergency situations.

## Features

- **Real-time Pathfinding**: Advanced navigation system that creates optimal rescue routes in real-time
- **Building Map Integration**: Seamless integration with digital floor plans and building layouts
- **Dynamic Environmental Mapping**: Continuous scanning and updating of environmental conditions
- **AI-Driven Decision Making**: Intelligent path calculation considering multiple safety factors
- **AR Visualization**: Augmented Reality interfaces for intuitive navigation
- **Mesh Network Communication**: Reliable communication in signal-challenging environments

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Django
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Database**: (To be specified)
- **Additional Technologies**:
  - SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
  - A* Pathfinding Algorithm
  - Building Information Modeling (BIM)
  - Augmented Reality (AR)
  - Mesh Network Communication
